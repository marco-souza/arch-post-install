## How to use it

Just clone the project, edit `arch-post-install/data/apps.json` to put your favorite apps and run `./post-install` from inside the cloned folder.

```sh

```

## Defining apps to be installed

The file `data/apps.json` specifies apps for each installer.

We support 3 kinds of installers:
